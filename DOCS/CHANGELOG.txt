  installation module.

1.2.2.ub1604lts - November 01, 2017

- Added extra firewall rules to open vncproxy/spicehtml5 ports
  to the same origin network used by Horizon.
- Added extra config items to neutron install module.

1.2.1.ub1604lts - October 17, 2017

- Added missing nova-placement port on firewall master
  script.
- Updated cinder-services sequence on openstack-control.sh
  script.

1.2.0.ub1604lts - August 24, 2017

- Completely reworked security model.
- Added extra variables on the main-config.rc file
  used to fine-tune iptables rules applied to the
  openstack server.

  to fine-tune workers on most openstack modules.

1.1.8.ub1604lts - July 26, 2017

- Added extra check secuences for possible failures
  on libvirt related services.

1.1.7.ub1604lts - July 20, 2017

- Added even more extra-checks and more install
  secuences on requeriments and novainstall modules
  in order to really ensure libvirt correct packages
  installation across some possible operating system
  configurations.

1.1.6.ub1604lts - July 20, 2017

- More changes and extra-checks to libvirt modules in
  order to cover possible packaging problems in the
  future.

1.1.5.ub1604lts - July 20, 2017

- Finally fixed all old-dependencies to libvirt-bin
  packages. Requirements and nova installation modules
  fixed to use libvirt-daemon-system. Now, nova does
  not fail to install. The original ocata packages
  used libvirt-bin but this is now broken. Using
  libvirt-daemon-system ensure proper nova installation.
- Added extra checks for openstack-control.sh script in
  order to allow apache to survice when a stop/restart
  is sent to specific services using mod_wsgi if keystone
  is installed and serving using apache.
- Added new "systemd" service (and documented in the main
  readme) used to allow correct boot of all openstack
  services at boot-time using openstack-control.sh. With
  this, it is no longer needed to include anything extra
  on rc.local.
- Added some extra packages to the requirements module.

- Extra configurations added in order to make
  interactions between cinder and nova more fool-
  proof.
- Added Cinder endpoints for V3 (volumev3).
- Added extra configuration items for more control
  in how to delete volumes in Cinder (see main
  config).

1.1.1.ub1604lts - March 31, 2017

- Included new variable "tenant_network_types" (set
  by default to "gre") to add more control to neutron
  installation module.
- Added extra information regarding trove and magnum
  requirements on the main readme and into the main
  configuration file.

1.1.0.ub1604lts - March 27, 2017

- Included Magnum (Container infrastructure as a 
  Service) install option.
- General typo fixes.

1.0.2.ub1604lts - March 25, 2017

- Bugfix: Removed some leftovers regarding glusterfs
  support in cinder.

1.0.1.ub1604lts - March 25, 2017

- Fully removed glusterfs cinder volume backend option.
  The driver was deprecated (but still available) on
  Newton release, but completelly removed on Ocata.
- Added snapshoot and qcow support on our implementation
  of the NFS driver on Cinder.

1.0.0.ub1604lts - March 24, 2017

- All modules adapted to OpenStack Rel 15 "Ocata".
- MongoDB fully deprecated in favor of GNOCCHI. All
  needed configurations and installation actions are
  performed by ceilometer install module, which also
  installs and configure gnocchi.
- As a result of gnocchi introduction, all metric re-
  lated functions are performed by gnocchi. This also
  include client interactions, that need to be per-
  formed using openstack client instead of old ceilo-
  metet client.
- Because we are using gnocchi now, ceilometer end-
  points in keystone are no longer needed (so they are
  not created). Also, the ceilometer-api is not con-
  figured either. All metric and events are now con-
  sumed trough gnocchi and aodh clients using the
  python openstack cli.
- CELLS setup included in the installer. Because now
  cell setup is "mandatory" for nova, our installer
  takes the apropiate steps to install and configure
  all needed support, including the new cell db.
- New placement api included in nova setup. The API is
  served trough a WSGI using apache.
- Some API's are using apache now (trough wsgi). Those
  include:
  * aodh-api.
  * placement-api (part of nova now).
  * cinder-api (only in Ubuntu based installs).
  * gnocchi-api.
- Designate install module adjusted to use the worker/
  producer model.
